"The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness"," Doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money - investing, personal finance, and business decisions - is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.  In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics.

"Same as Ever: Timeless Lessons on Risk, Opportunity and Living a Good Life"," When planning for the future we often ask, “What will the economy be doing this time next year?” Or, “What will be different ten years from now?”  But forecasting is hard. The important events that will shape the future are inherently unpredictable.  Instead, we should be asking a different question:  What will be the same ten years from now?  What will be the same one hundred years from now?  Knowledge of the things that never change is more useful, and more important, than an uncertain prediction of an unknowable future.  In Same As Ever, bestselling author Morgan Housel shares 24 short stories about the ways that life, behaviour, and business will always be the same.  Armed with this knowledge of the unchanging, you will have a powerful new ability to think about risk, opportunity, and how to navigate the uncertainty of the future.  As you see familiar themes repeat again and again in the years ahead, you’ll find yourself nodding and saying, “Yep, same as ever.” ",Morgan Housel,Chris Hill, 7 November 2023 ,Harriman House, 5 hours and 46 minutes , English , Unabridged , Audiobook ,©2023 Morgan Housel (P)2023 Penguin Audio,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,275 ratings"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow"," Brought to you by Penguin.Daniel Kahneman's pioneering work that tackles questions of intuition and rationality, read by Patrick Egan.In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a ground-breaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. One system is fast, intuitive and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities-and also the faults and biases-of fast thinking and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness-each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgements and decisions.Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our professional and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you take decisions and experience the world.

Breaking the Mould: Reimagining India's Economic Future," Where is India going today? Is it surging forward, having just overtaken the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world? Or is it flailing, unable to provide jobs for the millions joining the labor force? What should India do to secure a better future?India is at a crossroads today. Its growth rate, while respectable relative to other large countries, is too low for the jobs our youth need. Intense competition in low-skilled manufacturing, increasing protectionism globally and growing automation make the situation still more difficult. Divisive majoritarianism does not help. India broke away from the standard development path―from agriculture to low-skilled manufacturing, then high-skilled manufacturing and, finally, services―a long time back by leapfrogging the intermediate steps. Rather than attempting to revert to development paths that may not be feasible any more, we must embark on a truly Indian path.In this book, the authors explain how we can accelerate economic development by investing in our people’s human capital, expanding opportunities in high-skilled services and manufacturing centered on innovative new products, and making India a ferment of ideas and creativity. India’s democratic traditions will support this path, helped further by governance reforms, including strengthening our democratic institutions and greater decentralization.The authors offer praise where the Indian establishment has been successful but are clear-eyed in pointing out its weaknesses. They urge India to break free from the shackles of the past and look to the possibilities of the future. Written with unusual candor, and packed with vivid examples and persuasive arguments, this is a book for anyone who has a stake in India’s future.PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.

Think and Grow Rich," ""Think and Grow Rich"" is a motivational personal development and selfhelp audiobook written by Napoleon Hill and inspired by a suggestion from Scottish-American businessman Andrew Carnegie.

For instance, Jim Murray (sportswriter) wrote that ""Think and Grow Rich"" was credited for Ken Norton's boxing upset of Muhammad Ali in 1973.  The book was first published in 1937 during the Great Depression. At the time of Hill's death in 1970, ""Think and Grow Rich"" had sold 20 million copies.

The Bhagavad Gita," The Bhagavad Gita, ""The Song of the Lord"", is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Easwaran's reliable and accessible version has consistently been the best-selling translation. Easwaran's introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems - it's not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. ""The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita's subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage"" to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwaran's book The Bhagavad Gita. Narrated by Paul Bazely, an actor of Indian heritage and a longtime student of Easwaran.

Man's Search for Meaning," Man’s Search for Meaning is the chilling yet inspirational story of Viktor Frankl’s struggle to hold on to hope during the unspeakable horrors of his years as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of those he treated in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.  Through every waking moment of his ordeal, Frankl’s training as a psychiatrist lent him a remarkable perspective on the psychology of survival. As a result of these experiences, Dr. Frankl developed a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy known as logotherapy. At the core of his theory is the belief that man’s primary motivational force is his search for meaning. Frankl’s assertion that “the will to meaning” is the basic motivation for human life has forever changed the way we understand our humanity in the face of suffering.  Frankl’s riveting memoir was named one of the 10 Most Influential Books in America after a 1991 survey by the Library of Congress and Book of the Month Club. This revised and updated version includes a new postscript: “The Case for a Tragic Optimism”. ",Viktor E.

A Way in the World: A Novel," In a vastly innovative novel, Nobel Prize-winner V. S. Naipaul intertwines memory and history to create what is at once an autobiography and an ambitious fictional archaeology of colonialism.Spanning continents and centuries and defying literary categories, A Way in the World tells intersecting stories whose protagonists include the disgraced and half-demented Sir Walter Raleigh, who seeks El Dorado in the New World; the 19th-century insurgent Francisco Miranda, who becomes entangled in his own fantasies and borrowed ideas; and the doomed Blair, a present-day Caribbean revolutionary stranded in East Africa. Among these presences is a narrator who bears a telling resemblance to Naipaul himself: a Trinidadian writer of Indian ancestry and English residence boldly trying to come to terms with the mystery and transience that is his inheritance.

The Art of War," The 13 chapters of The Art of War, each devoted to one aspect of warfare, were compiled by the high-ranking Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher Sun-Tzu. In spite of its battlefield specificity, The Art of War has found new life in the modern age, with leaders in fields as wide and far-reaching as world politics, human psychology, and corporate strategy finding valuable insight in its timeworn words. Aidan Gillen - who has learned a thing or two about strategy through his roles as skilled manipulator Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish (Game of Thrones) and ambitious politician Tommy Carcetti (The Wire) - brilliantly performs this ancient classic. His experience in portraying insightful and, at times, cunning characters makes him a natural fit for this ancient collection of battlefield epigrams whose influence has grown tremendously in the modern world.

"Same as Ever: Timeless Lessons on Risk, Opportunity and Living a Good Life"," When planning for the future we often ask, “What will the economy be doing this time next year?” Or, “What will be different ten years from now?”  But forecasting is hard. The important events that will shape the future are inherently unpredictable.  Instead, we should be asking a different question:  What will be the same ten years from now?  What will be the same one hundred years from now?  Knowledge of the things that never change is more useful, and more important, than an uncertain prediction of an unknowable future.  In Same As Ever, bestselling author Morgan Housel shares 24 short stories about the ways that life, behaviour, and business will always be the same.  Armed with this knowledge of the unchanging, you will have a powerful new ability to think about risk, opportunity, and how to navigate the uncertainty of the future.  As you see familiar themes repeat again and again in the years ahead, you’ll find yourself nodding and saying, “Yep, same as ever.” ",Morgan Housel,Chris Hill, 7 November 2023 ,Harriman House, 5 hours and 46 minutes , English , Unabridged , Audiobook ,©2023 Morgan Housel (P)2023 Penguin Audio,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,275 ratings"

Breaking the Mould: Reimagining India's Economic Future," Where is India going today? Is it surging forward, having just overtaken the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world? Or is it flailing, unable to provide jobs for the millions joining the labor force? What should India do to secure a better future?India is at a crossroads today. Its growth rate, while respectable relative to other large countries, is too low for the jobs our youth need. Intense competition in low-skilled manufacturing, increasing protectionism globally and growing automation make the situation still more difficult. Divisive majoritarianism does not help. India broke away from the standard development path―from agriculture to low-skilled manufacturing, then high-skilled manufacturing and, finally, services―a long time back by leapfrogging the intermediate steps. Rather than attempting to revert to development paths that may not be feasible any more, we must embark on a truly Indian path.In this book, the authors explain how we can accelerate economic development by investing in our people’s human capital, expanding opportunities in high-skilled services and manufacturing centered on innovative new products, and making India a ferment of ideas and creativity. India’s democratic traditions will support this path, helped further by governance reforms, including strengthening our democratic institutions and greater decentralization.The authors offer praise where the Indian establishment has been successful but are clear-eyed in pointing out its weaknesses. They urge India to break free from the shackles of the past and look to the possibilities of the future. Written with unusual candor, and packed with vivid examples and persuasive arguments, this is a book for anyone who has a stake in India’s future.PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.

Elon Musk," Écrit par l’auteur de la biographie autorisée de Steve Jobs, voici le récit intime de l’innovateur le plus fascinant et le plus controversé de la planète. Visionnaire défiant toutes les règles, Elon Musk est l’homme qui a fait entrer le monde dans l’ère des voitures électriques, de l’exploration spatiale privée et de l’intelligence artificielle. Ah, au fait : il a aussi racheté Twitter.Durant son enfance en Afrique du Sud, Elon Musk est la cible des violences de ses camarades. Un jour, une bande le pousse du haut d’une volée de marches et le roue de coups, réduisant son visage à une masse de chair boursouflée. Il passe une semaine à l’hôpital. Mais les blessures physiques sont peu de choses face aux balafres émotionnelles que lui inflige son père, ingénieur véreux et rêveur charismatique. À son retour chez lui, ce dernier le traite d’idiot et de bon à rien.L’ombre portée de son père pèsera longtemps sur lui. Musk est devenu un homme-enfant coriace mais vulnérable, doté d’une tolérance anormalement élevée au risque, d’un goût brûlant pour le scandale, d’un instinct messianique grandiose et d’une ardeur impitoyable quand elle n’est pas funeste.Début 2022 – à la suite d’une année marquée par le lancement de trente et un satellites par SpaceX, la vente d’un million de Tesla et sa consécration en tant qu’homme le plus riche de la planète –, Musk déplore sa tendance à semer la zizanie.Dans le même temps, il achète des parts de Twitter en secret et devient le propriétaire du terrain de jeu le plus convoité du monde – sa revanche contre les violences subies à l’école.Pendant deux ans, Isaacson a marché dans les pas de Musk, suivi ses réunions, parcouru ses usines avec lui ; il l’a interviewé pendant des heures, ainsi que sa famille, ses amis, ses collègues et ses adversaires. En résulte un ouvrage révélateur, émaillé de récits fabuleux où alternent cataclysmes et triomphes, et qui pose la question suivante : les démons qui aiguillonnent Musk sont-ils aussi le moteur du progrès ?

Early Indians," Who are we Indians? Where did we come from? To tell us the story of our ancestry, journalist Tony Joseph goes 65,000 years into the past–when a band of Homo sapiens first made their way from Africa into the Indian subcontinent. These were the First Indians. Citing recent DNA evidence, he traces the subsequent large migrations of modern humans into India–of a people related to early farmers of Iran who mixed with the First Indians at the latest between 5400 BCE and 3700 BCE and of the ‘Arya’ between 2000 BCE and 1500 BCE, among others. As Joseph unravels our past, he takes head-on some of the most controversial and uncomfortable questions of Indian history: Who were the Harappans? Are north Indians genetically different from south Indians? When did the caste system emerge? A hugely significant book, Early Indians bravely puts to rest several fierce debates on the ancestry of modern Indians.

"1947-1957, India: The Birth of a Republic"," The first decade after India's independence, 1947-1957, was probably the most crucial in the nation's history. Opening a window to this period, this book weaves a story out of the complex ideas and events that have largely remained beneath the surface of public discourse. The transfer of power, the framing of the Constitution and the formation of the governance machinery; the clash of ideas and ideologies among parties and personalities; the beginning of the disintegration of the Congress and the consolidation of political forces in the opposition; Nehru's grappling with existential problems at home and his quest for global peace; the interplay between democratic ideals and ruthless power play—all these factors impinged on each other and shaped the new republic in its formative decade. Thought-provoking, argumentative and thoroughly enjoyable, 1947-1957, India: The Birth of a Republic is a must-listen for anyone interested in Indian political history.

Talk to Strangers: The Yes Theory Story," If you were 99 years old and on your deathbed and were given a chance to come back to today, what would you do right now?  Matt Dahlia was a recent college grad with no direction in his life: his business was dead on arrival and all his friends had left town. He was broke and searching for belonging in a world that didn’t understand him. That is, until he serendipitously met Thomas, who not only felt the same way he did, but had a project in mind: Together, along with two more like-minded strangers, they were going to move into a one-bedroom apartment and film themselves doing 30 things they had never done before in 30 days.  That summer project changed their lives forever: it pushed them out of their comfort zones, bonded them for life, and allowed them to reach a wide audience online. Their journey would eventually become Yes Theory, a massive movement of millions of people living by the philosophy of seeking discomfort.  In this memoir, Matt reveals the extreme highs and lows of Yes Theory, sharing his own along the way. This is a story about the sacrifices it takes to make a dream come true, what happens when a small group of friends suddenly have the attention of millions of strangers online, and what it means to say goodbye when everything seems to be going so well.  But most of all, it’s a reminder to ask yourself that most important question: what do you want out of life?

Infectious Generosity: The Ultimate Idea Worth Spreading," Brought to you by Penguin.Perhaps the simplest, most powerful moral question you can ask of your life is: 'Am I a net giver, or a net taker?'  As head of TED for the past 20 years, Chris Anderson has had a ringside view of the world's most significant thinkers sharing their boldest ideas across every imaginable discipline. Yet there's a single theme that stands out in his mind as the essential connecting thread: generosity.  It may seem simple, but generosity has played a key role in building the tools, knowledge, and institutions that have allowed civilisation to flourish. Now, in our unsettled modern world, beset by disruption and division, Anderson believes our collective future depends on reconnecting to this vital human trait.  In this profound and inspiring book, Anderson shows how the same technologies that have been a catalyst for negativity can be turned into an exponential force for good - to create chain reactions of generous behaviour. The potential lies in every one of us, right now - for generosity, it turns out, is wired deeply inside you. Gifts of time, talent, connection and kindness have always been part of what it is to be a good human. What's different today, Anderson reveals, is the power each of us has - if we'd only stop to think about it - to catalyse world-changing, self-replicating impact.  The people, companies, investors and organisations who understand this, who prioritise generosity - who give more to the world than they take from it - are the ones that will own the future. And they'll be happier as a result.  This book shows you how.

Optimal: How to Sustain Excellence Every Day," Brought to you by Penguin.  Emotional intelligence is now embedded in our public discourse: an idea so pervasive and important in our work, culture, politics and society that leaders such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and New York City mayor Eric Adams have placed it at the heart of what they do.  Daniel Goleman's bestselling book Emotional Intelligence was the first to coin this idea and bring it to a mass audience. Now, more than a quarter of a century after it was first published, he and Rutgers professor of psychology Cary Cherniss take a fresh look at how emotional intelligence has evolved over the past few decades, reframing its importance in this definitive book.  Beginning with a dissection of what makes for individual success, Goleman and Cherniss then set out how high performance can be cultivated at every level, scaling up the concept to top team performance and outstanding organisations. Building on attributes such as self-awareness, a sense of meaning and emotional balance, high concentration and 'flow' states, they demonstrate that it is in our optimal moments that our mental clarity shines.

"The Other Name: Septology I-II (Septology, Book 1)"," The Other Name follows the lives of two men living close to each other on the west coast of Norway. The year is coming to a close and Asle, an aging painter and widower, is reminiscing about his life. He lives alone, his only friends being his neighbor, Åsleik, a bachelor and traditional Norwegian fisherman-farmer, and Beyer, a gallerist who lives in Bjørgvin, a couple hours drive south of Dylgja, where he lives. There, in Bjørgvin, lives another Asle, also a painter. He and the narrator are doppelgangers—two versions of the same person, two versions of the same life.Written in hypnotic prose that shifts between the first and third person, The Other Name calls into question concrete notions around subjectivity and the self. What makes us who we are? And why do we lead one life and not another? Through flashbacks, Fosse deftly explores the convergences and divergences in the lives of both Asles, slowly building towards a decisive encounter between them both. A writer at the zenith of his career, with The Other Name, the first two volumes in his Septology, Fosse presents us with an indelible and poignant exploration of the human condition that will endure as his masterpiece.

The Wave Principle," The Elliott Wave Principle, formulated by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, stands as a prominent tool in technical analysis, aiming to forecast market trends by discerning recurring wave patterns in financial markets. Rooted in the idea that market price movements aren't random but rather follow identifiable patterns shaped by investor psychology, this theory has gained significant traction.Elliott's framework categorizes waves into two main types: impulse waves and corrective waves. Impulse waves, constituting five distinct moves, align with the primary trend—whether upward or downward. On the other hand, corrective waves, comprising three moves, run counter to the prevailing trend, acting as periods of consolidation or retracement.Practically, analysts employ chart analysis to identify these wave patterns, labeling each wave numerically or alphabetically. To refine their wave counts and predictions, they use Fibonacci ratios, trendlines, and other technical indicators. The key premise is that understanding the psychological factors influencing market participants allows for anticipating future price movements.Traders and investors commonly apply the Elliott Wave analysis to various financial instruments, including stocks, commodities, and forex. Advocates argue that the predictive power of the Elliott Wave Theory can enhance decision-making in trading and investment strategies. However, critics emphasize the subjectivity in wave interpretation and the complexity of market dynamics, making consistent application challenging.In practice, adherents use the Elliott Wave Principle to identify entry and exit points based on the anticipated continuation or reversal of trends. Despite its popularity, it's crucial to approach Elliott Wave analysis with caution, acknowledging that market behavior is influenced by numerous factors, and no single approach guarantees success.

The Untouchables: Who Were They and Why They Became Untouchables," The Untouchables: who were they and why they became UntouchablesIn this book Dr. Ambedkar presents his conclusions that are the result of such historical research as he has been able to make.It contains the novel thesis that comprises the following propositions and his explanation of the same and evidence as to how he arrived at them:(1) There is no racial difference between the Hindus and the Untouchables(2) The distinction between the Hindus and Untouchables in its original form, before the advent of Untouchability, was the distinction between Tribesmen and Broken Men from alien Tribes. It is the Broken Men who subsequently came to be treated as Untouchables(3) Just as Untouchability has no racial basis so also has it no occupational basis(4) There are two roots from which Untouchability has sprung:(a) Contempt and hatred of the Broken Men as of Buddhists by the Brahmins(b) Continuation of beef-eating by the Broken Men after it had been given up by others.(5) In searching for the origin of Untouchability care must be taken to distinguish the Untouchables from the Impure. All orthodox Hindu writers have identified the Impure with the Untouchables. This is an error. Untouchables are distinct from the Impure.(6) While the Impure as a class came into existence at the time of the Dharma Sutras the Untouchables came into being much later than 400 A.DThis book is a a must for those who are from the community, and also for allies in the anti-caste struggle.To know who we are, and why we became the untouchables is very crucial, if not, the most crucial element needed to break our shackles and emancipate ourselves.So please listen and share this audiobook with one and all!Jai Bhim!

Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India," Penguin presents the audiobook edition of Inglorious Empire written and read by Shashi Tharoor. In the eighteenth century, India's share of the world economy was as large as Europe's. By 1947, after two centuries of British rule, it had decreased six-fold. The Empire blew rebels from cannon, massacred unarmed protesters, entrenched institutionalised racism, and caused millions to die from starvation.British imperialism justified itself as enlightened despotism for the benefit of the governed, but Shashi Tharoor takes demolishes this position, demonstrating how every supposed imperial 'gift' - from the railways to the rule of law - was designed in Britain's interests alone. He goes on to show how Britain's Industrial Revolution was founded on India's deindustrialisation, and the destruction of its textile industry.In this bold and incisive reassessment of colonialism, Tharoor exposes to devastating effect the inglorious reality of Britain's stained Indian legacy.

Meri Gita," In Meri Gita, acclaimed mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik demystifies The Bhagavad Gita for the contemporary listener. His unique approach - thematic rather than verse-by-verse - makes the ancient treatise eminently accessible.In a world that seems spellbound by argument over dialogue, vi-vaad over sam-vaad, Devdutt highlights how Krishna nudges Arjuna to understand rather than judge his relationships. This becomes relevant today when we are increasingly indulging and isolating the self (self-improvement, self-actualization, self-realization - even selfies!) We forget that we live in an ecosystem of others, where we can nourish each other with food, love and meaning, even when we fight. So let My Gita inform your Gita.

The Tatas: How a Family Built a Business and a Nation," Winner of the Gaja Capital Business Book Prize 2019The 19th century was an exciting time of initiative and enterprise around the world. If John D. Rockefeller was creating unimagined wealth in the United States that he would put to the service of the nation, a Parsi family with humble roots was doing the same in India. In 1822, a boy was born in a priestly household in Gujarat's Navsari village. Young Nusserwanji knew early on that his destiny lay beyond his village and decided to head for Bombay to start a business - the first in his family to do so. He had neither higher education nor knowledge of business matters, just a burning passion to carve a path of his own. What Nusserwanji started as a cotton trading venture, his son Jamsetji, born in the same year as Rockefeller, grew into a multifaceted business, turning around sick textile mills, setting up an iron and steel company, envisioning a cutting-edge institute of higher learning, building a world-class hotel, and earning himself the title of the 'Bhishma Pitamah of Indian Industry'. Stewarded ably over the decades by Jamsetji's sons, Dorabji and Ratanji, the charismatic and larger-than-life JRD, and thereafter the more businesslike Ratan, the Tata group today is a $110 billion empire. The Tatas is their story. But it is more than just a history of the industrial house; it is an inspiring account of India in the making. It chronicles how each generation of the family invested not only in the expansion of its own business interests but also in nation building. Few know, for instance, that the first hydel power project in the world was conceived of and built by the Tatas. Nor that some radical labour concepts such as eight-hour work shifts were born in India, at the Tata mill in Nagpur. The Tata Cancer Research Centre, the Indian Institute of Science, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and the national carrier Air India - the family has a long, rich and unrivalled legacy. The Tatas is a tribute to a line of visionaries who have a special place in the hearts and minds of ordinary Indians. Written by seasoned journalist Girish Kuber, this is also the only book that tells the complete Tata story spanning almost 200 years.

The Story of My Experiments with Truth: An Autobiography," To mark the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, DK presents the audiobook of The Story of My Experiments with Truth: An Autobiography, narrated by Sagar Arya.Gandhi's nonviolent struggles against racism, violence and colonialism in South Africa and India had brought him to such a level of notoriety and adulation that when asked to write an autobiography midway through his career, he took it as an opportunity to explain himself. He feared the enthusiasm for his ideas tended to exceed a deeper understanding of his quest for truth rooted in devotion to God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices, celibacy and a life without violence. This is not a straightforward narrative biography. In The Story of My Experiments with Truth: An Autobiography, Gandhi offers his life story as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps.A well-known Indian actor, Sagar Arya has narrated over 35 audiobooks, including White Teeth by Zadie Smith, Love Like Blood by Mark Billingham and audiobooks by Amish, and he brings his wealth of knowledge to this production. His television credits include A Touch of Frost, Hunted, Spooks, Casualty and Holby City. He appeared as Claudio in RSC's Much Ado About Nothing as well as Twelfth Night (West End), The Great Game (Tricycle)and A Fine Balance (Hampstead). ",M. K.

Asura: Tale of the Vanquished: The Story of Ravana and His People," The epic tale of victory and defeatThe story of the Ramayana had been told innumerable times. The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence. But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana had never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed outcastes of India for 3,000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak. For thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor's tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.I am a non-entity - invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama - the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour - Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed for them. It is when that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.

The Sandman," Please note: This content is not for kids. It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. Hailed by the Los Angeles Times Magazine as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, The Sandman changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the New York Times best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that The Sandman originally re-defined the graphic novel. When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.

The Psychology of Happiness," Despite being discussed, questioned, philosophized about, and sought after since the days of Aristotle, the pathways to happiness are not always clear...but there is one. In order to find it, you need a solid foundation for understanding what really makes us - as humans - happy. And that’s exactly what you will gain by learning what science has to say about the big questions of happiness and thriving.Throughout 10 lectures, Professor Jaime Kurtz will outline the physical and emotional benefits that a boost in happiness can bring you. Professor Kurtz will invite you to access those benefits with a range of science-based strategies that you can choose from - strategies that will help you create more happiness in your everyday life. As you examine the effect of both the tools and challenges to being happy, including mindfulness, exercise, nature, social media, money, and more, you’ll gain practical knowledge - useful things that you can start practicing in your life, immediately.

Meri Gita," In Meri Gita, acclaimed mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik demystifies The Bhagavad Gita for the contemporary listener. His unique approach - thematic rather than verse-by-verse - makes the ancient treatise eminently accessible.In a world that seems spellbound by argument over dialogue, vi-vaad over sam-vaad, Devdutt highlights how Krishna nudges Arjuna to understand rather than judge his relationships. This becomes relevant today when we are increasingly indulging and isolating the self (self-improvement, self-actualization, self-realization - even selfies!) We forget that we live in an ecosystem of others, where we can nourish each other with food, love and meaning, even when we fight. So let My Gita inform your Gita.

Sapiens," New York Times Best Seller  A Summer Reading Pick for President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg  From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution - a number one international best seller - that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human”. One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one - Homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?  Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.  Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?  This provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential listening for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.Please note: This audiobook is in Hindi.
